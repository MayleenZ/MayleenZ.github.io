        I started my crochet journey on black friday since the yarn was buy
        two get one free at Michaels. I was so excited to pick up a new hobby
        and crochet a beanie. I also kept misplacing my store bought beanie so this 
        was a fun way to keep making more. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The beanie came out a bit bigger than expected because I didn't count the loops.
        <span class="inline">It did not have clean borders</span> like the one in the video but I still enjoyed the process. I
        gifted the beanie to my partner.

        My second project included making another beanie but this time for myself. 
        I wanted to work on making it smaller and with <span class="inline">cleaner borders</span>. Previously, my 
        borders were jagged and curvy. I used the same video as my first project to construct 
        my beanie.
